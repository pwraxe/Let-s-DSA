Find LEFT CHILD of Node : (2i + 1)   //i = index 
Find RIGHT CHILD of Node : (2i + 2)  //i = index

Fina PARENT of Child :  ((i - 1)/2).toInt()

NOTE: For IMP

- When We insert element in list and then try for Either minHeap or Max Heap, we usually starts from lastIndex and goes to 0th index
- When We Remove Element we can remove only and only root element (0th index) from array by swapping 0th index element with last index element
  then we Go from 0th index to last index by finding leftChildIndex and rightChildIndex
