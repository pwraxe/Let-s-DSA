- Greedy Choose the Best Option available at moment
- Greedy doesn't worry whether the current best optimal will bring overall optimal result or not
- Greedy never reverses a result if choice is wrong
- Greedy always Goes for the local best choice to produce the global best choice
- Greedy Doesn't always produce optimal solution

We can use Greedy approach to Problem if the problem has the following property
1. Greedy Choice Property = If you can choose the best option at a given step without re-considering the previous step
2. Optimal SubStructure = if the local optimal Solution brings you to the global optimal
