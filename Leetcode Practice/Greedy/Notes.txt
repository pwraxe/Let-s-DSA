- Greedy Choose the Best Option available at the moment
- Greedy doesn't worry whether the current best optimal will bring overall optimal result or not
- Greedy never reverses a result if the choice is wrong
- Greedy always Goes for the local best choice to produce the global best choice
- Greedy Doesn't always produce an optimal solution

We can use the Greedy approach to the Problem if the problem has the following property
1. Greedy Choice Property = If you can choose the best option at a given step without re-considering the previous step
2. Optimal SubStructure = if the local optimal Solution brings you to the global optimal

Things should know for Greedy
- Optimization (min or max)
- Sorting of the input list
- Greedy Has No Fixed rule (it's ad-hoc based)
- Usually we don't realised we have applied greedy approach to problem even its not
