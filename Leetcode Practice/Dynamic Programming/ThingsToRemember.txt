Following some tips or things to solving DP problem

- Check for Overlapping Subproblem
- Check for dependency on previous decision
- Data Structure for State Variable
- Create function, what it takes, what it returns
- What is small version of problem (its define base case)
- Try first Recursion then add Memorization to it then Tabulation

- Draw Recurrance Relation Tree and Create/Find out Recurrance relation or internal flow
- Recurrance relation based on selection, dependency, exact match/notMatch to output, 

- Think about take or not take concept
- if string or array as an input then index is default single default state variable
