Following are some tips or things to solving DP problem

- Check for Overlapping Subproblem
- Check for dependency on a previous decision
- Data Structure for State Variable
- Create function, what it takes, what it returns
- What is a small version of the problem (its defined base case)
- Try first Recursion then add Memorization to it then Tabulation

- Draw a Recurrence Relation Tree and Create/Find out the Recurrence relation or internal flow
- Recurrence relation based on selection, dependency, exact match/notMatch to output, 

- Think about taking or not taking the concept
- if string or array is input then index is default single default state variable
- Check if you are removing something from input, taking max or min from input at each time
- Check, if does input is forming by output or output is forming by input
- Create the state variable (Data Structure/ Memoizing) based on the return type of function
   Ex. fun isWork(..): Boolean --> create BooleanArray
       fun getMin(...): Int --> Cerate IntArray etc. etc.
