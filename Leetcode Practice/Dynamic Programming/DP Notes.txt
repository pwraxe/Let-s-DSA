Greedy Method
=============

Greedy: If input is feasible then we include input in solution/output
//OR
Take only that solution/Input which satisfy given input constrains


Dynamic Programming Notes
=========================

It Explore all possible solution systematically and efficiently.
It is capable of solving a wide variety of problems which has following characteristics
	1. Overlapping Subproblems
	2. Optimal Substructure

Greedy has Optimal Structure, but not overlapping subproblem
Devide & Conquer break problem into subproblem, but subproblem are not overlapping

DP is Powerful tool becoz it break complex problem in managable subproblem (avoid repeatation sub-calculation)
DP also helps to improved TimeComplexity

2 Ways to implement DP
	1. Tabulation: Bottom-Up Approach
	2. Memorization: Top-Down Apprach
